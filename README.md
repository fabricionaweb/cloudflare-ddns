# Cloudflare record update

Small scripts to update cloudflare dns records with your current ip (Dynamic DNS).

You need load the `.env` in memory before runs the `ddns.py` (or hard code the values).

You can register a cronjob to execute in an interval of choice.

# OpenWrt

Bash script to run on OpenWrt without dependencies.

I'll add more instructions about use it with [Hotplug](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/base-system/hotplug)
